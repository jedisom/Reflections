What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git will create a .git hidden folder that will allow you to start storing
	information about commits you have made.  If you don't do it, git can't 
	track revisions for you.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is a place where git keeps track of the files that will
	be commited the next time a commit command is called.  It's like limbo in
	between the current commit and the next one.

change?
