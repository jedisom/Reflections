When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You would want to use a remote repository if you want to share your work with other 
  people.  It would also be a great way to work if you are creating code on several
  different devices; the information could be shared and transferred via Git Hub.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I'm not sure.  One thought is that you might have different versions/branches on 
	GitHub that you don't want to work with on your local computer.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
	branches are different revision paths repositories that may have different programming
	or content for experimentation, etc.  Fork are like branches, but are done on GitHub 
	and allow you to copy someone elses repository and build off of it without affecting 
	their repository.  Cloning is the process of copying what is in a repository into 
	another repository.  Cloning can be done from GitHub to your computer, or within your
	local computer.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Having the last known state of the remote stored locally allows you to work off of the
	most recent changes on your computer without being connected to the internet.  It also
	is a check to make sure you haven't missed any changes potentially put into the repository
	by any of your other collaborators.
